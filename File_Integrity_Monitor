- This will be the third of five projects taken from Josh Madakor's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9wz0Sted_I
  - This is the video of the actual tutorial that I am following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJODYmk4ys8
  - I will be providing commentary and walk-thru as proof of completing this project.
  
- It will provide me with experience in the following:
  - Creating a custom/proof of concept File Integrity Monitor (FIM) that allows for:
    - Creating an integrity baseline of target files/folders using the SHA-512 hashing algorithm.
    - Continuously making comparison of actual files vs. baseline, raising alerts if any deviations occur.
    - Send alert x-alert via y-means to allow further investigation of potential compromise.
